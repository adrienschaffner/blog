        <p>Long ago...</p>
        <p>I studied work law and human resources for several years. <br>
        Thanks to that I worked as a specialist recruiter for more than four years, until I discovered the Product Management existence. <br>
        To sum up, the lack of skilled trades people are factors to the intensity of this work, what makes it a
        challenging opportunity and in the same time a way to increase my versatility, from my professional understanding of
        client's needs to my ability to answer to any complex request.
        <br>
        <%# During this career I switched from a great but older company to another, more of a start up, and that's when I entered a new way
        to work, faster, modern and dealing with new technology. <br>
        Surrounded by recruiters, I was more focused on the client side, trying to find a way to help them in their specific needs and issues with the help of an AI.
        I reported weekly about the market evolution and was able to propose new directions to follow. <br> %>
        During my last experience in Human Resources I discovered what is a Product Manager, what does he do, and understood that is what I wanted to do from now ! </p>
        <p>As a Product Manager, one of the main key is the technical background.
        So I quit, went to Le Wagon's bootcamp and learned to code from scratch with html, CSS & Ruby, to use
        RubyonRails Framework and to drive an end-to-end project. <br>
        At the end, with some other alumni, we decided to improve our skills and to practice what we learned with our own project.
        Crushs was born ! We set a time limit of 6 months and my part was essentially focused on the PM duties (but not only).
        In the same time, I tried on my own to build a markeplace in fashion with a specific vision : Casual. </p>

        <p>
        And that's it ! After struggling a little and learned a lot, here I am ! <i class="fa-solid fa-rocket orange"></i>

      <p>During my past career in Human Resources I switched from a great but quit old-fashioned company to another,
      more of a start up, and that's when I entered a new way
      to work, faster, modern and dealing with new technology. <br>
      Surrounded by recruiters, I was more focused on the client side, trying to find a way to help them in their specific needs and issues with the help of an AI.
      I reported weekly about the market evolution and was able to propose new directions to follow. </p>
      <p>I also added what I think has the most value as a Product Manager : My side projects as a Product Manager.</p>

<h2 class="about-title margin-10">Articles</h2>
<p>As a newcomer in the Product Management, I studied a lot about it. I read books, articles, listen to podcasts...
As I was working I told myself that it might be interesting to share what I was learning and what I wrote with
people like me that might also be curious about PM. <br>
When you know nothing, you may struggle a little to find where to begin, what is important and what is not,
to know the differences betwteen Lean, MVP, Scrum among other useful notions.
That is when the idea come to me to make my own blog about it.
Considering I am not an expert (for the moment), those articles are a way to share what I know and in the same
time to be sure that I understand clearly each topic.</p>
<p>
So, if you want to read some, it's right there :
