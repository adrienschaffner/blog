          <div class="journey-paragraph">
            <p>Long ago, far from the Product Management world...</p>
            <p>I used to work as a specialist recruiter for more than four years after studying work law and Human Resources. <br>
               It was a challenging opportunity and also a great way to increase my versatility, but in the same time
               I wanted to live the entrepreneurship experience at least once in my life and bring something
               meaningful to people by myself.<br>
               <%# from my professional understanding of client's needs to my ability to answer to any complex request with short deadlines. %>
            </p>
            <p>
              So I quit and analyzed several opportunities.
              Quickly I came to the conclusion that the futur is on the web and I have to dive into it &#127946.
            </p>

            <p>
              I went to Le Wagon's bootcamp to get a usefool technical background and there I learned to code from scratch with html, CSS & Ruby, to use
              RubyonRails framework and to drive an end-to-end project.
            </p>

            <p>Then, I discovered the Product Management existence &#129327. <br>
              A <b>BIG</b> revelation.</p>

            <p>
              After that, with some other alumni we set a time limit of 6 months to practice on our own project. <br>
              Great learning adventure ! My part was essentially focused on the Product Management accountabilities (but not only) and
              finally, after struggling a little and learned a lot since the beginning of this new experience... </p>
            <p>
              Here I am ! Ready to join your team ! &#128640

            of working : <br> faster, modern and dealing with new technology. <br>
            I was more focused on the client side, trying to find solutions to their specific needs with the help of an AI and a team of recruiters by my side.

            Among other missions, I reported weekly about the market evolution and was able to propose new directions to follow to the head of the company. <br> <br>
