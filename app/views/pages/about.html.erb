        <p>Long ago...</p>
        <p>I studied work law and human resources for several years. <br>
        Thanks to that I worked as a specialist recruiter for more than four years, until I discovered the Product Management existence. <br>
        To sum up, the lack of skilled trades people are factors to the intensity of this work, what makes it a
        challenging opportunity and in the same time a way to increase my versatility, from my professional understanding of
        client's needs to my ability to answer to any complex request.
        <br>
        <%# During this career I switched from a great but older company to another, more of a start up, and that's when I entered a new way
        to work, faster, modern and dealing with new technology. <br>
        Surrounded by recruiters, I was more focused on the client side, trying to find a way to help them in their specific needs and issues with the help of an AI.
        I reported weekly about the market evolution and was able to propose new directions to follow. <br> %>
        During my last experience in Human Resources I discovered what is a Product Manager, what does he do, and understood that is what I wanted to do from now ! </p>
        <p>As a Product Manager, one of the main key is the technical background.
        So I quit, went to Le Wagon's bootcamp and learned to code from scratch with html, CSS & Ruby, to use
        RubyonRails Framework and to drive an end-to-end project. <br>
        At the end, with some other alumni, we decided to improve our skills and to practice what we learned with our own project.
        Crushs was born ! We set a time limit of 6 months and my part was essentially focused on the PM duties (but not only).
        In the same time, I tried on my own to build a markeplace in fashion with a specific vision : Casual. </p>

        <p>
        And that's it ! After struggling a little and learned a lot, here I am ! <i class="fa-solid fa-rocket blue"></i>

    <p>As a newcomer in the Product Management, I studied a lot about it. I read books, articles, listen to podcasts...
    As I was working I told myself that it might be interesting to share what I was learning and what I wrote with
    people like me that might also be curious about PM. <br>
    When you know nothing, you may struggle a little to find where to begin, what is important and what is not,
    to know the differences between Lean, MVP, Scrum among other useful notions. <br>
    That is when the idea come to me to make my own blog about it.
    Considering I am not an expert (for the moment), those articles are a way to share what I know and in the same
    time to be sure that I understand clearly each topic.</p>
